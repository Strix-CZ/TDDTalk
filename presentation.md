# TDD

- Kent Beck (XP), Uncle Bob (Rober C Martin)

	   Test      <---\       Red
	   Code          |      Green, Commit
	   Refactor   ---/      Green, Commit


# Rules by Uncle Bob

1. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test
   that is sufficient to fail,
   and compilation failures are failures

2. You are not allowed to write any production code
   unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.

3. You are not allowed to write any more production code
   that is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

( "more production code..."
  === "more functionality of production code" )


# Detour via refactoring

- Improve code without changing the results
	- no bugfix
	- no new feature
	- no new test

- E.g.

	    Remove unnecessary code
	  | Remove unnecessary complexity
	  | Remove duplication (e.g. extract method)
	  | Make the code easier to read (e.g. rename)
	  | Increase cohesion
	  | Decrease coupling

- It should be a tiny change that we do every 5 minutes,
  not a project that you will plan to do next week.
  (If it's a project then do it in tiny steps anyway.)


# Rules by Kent Beck

1. Donâ€™t write a line of new code
   unless you first have a failing automated test.

2. Eliminate duplication.
   
   (=== Refactor or generalize code. No new functionality!)


# Example

- Have a look at commits in:
  https://github.com/Strix-CZ/TDDDemo

  Clone the repo or have a look in your browser:
  https://github.com/Strix-CZ/TDDDemo/commits/master

- The example follows Uncle Bob's rules.


# Observations

- What Kent Beck meant by duplication?
  Among other things also duplication between production code and tests.

	    if (values.length == 1)
	        return values[0] == values[1];

- By choosing next test you choose how big change you will implement.

- Tests should start with easiest cases and get more complex.

- Production code starts hardcoded and becomes more general over time.


# But but! That's crazy!

- Yes

- Try it as an excercise

    Pair!
    One tests,
    the other implements,
    both refactor.

- Then use the good parts behind TDD...


# Tests

- Not necessarily test first then code

- Good if you...
	- need as few bugs as possible
	- will maintain the code
	- need to make feedback loop faster

- If it's hard to refactor because of tests, you don't have good tests.
  (Reach out for help, this is hard.)


# Fast feedback loop

- Supports learning, be in zone, fun

- Tests / just run and see (art, game of life...).

- If you need to do 5 manual steps to reproduce an issue,
  it will be painful.


# Small increments

- It works after each step, it stays working

- Hard to come up with them (see Intentional change below)

- Good if...
	- the project is not tiny
	  (not possible to keep the whole codebase in mind)
	- you want record of reasoning process (code review)
	- minimize negative impact


# Intentional change

- Separate new functionality x refactoring x experiment

- Refactor after each step.
  (Reminder Should be small and often.)

- When you don't know, experiment.
  When done, rollback the change and continue (in small steps)
